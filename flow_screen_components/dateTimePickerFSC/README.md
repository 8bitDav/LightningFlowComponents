# Date Time Picker#

*** A Flow Component solution  ***

This is an extremely simple port of the {standard DateTimePicker}(https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref_ui_inputDateTime.htm) to work as a Flow Screen Component.



## Install this Component Into Your Org ##

If your org is running Spring '18 (or the Lightning Components in Flow Screens Pilot),  you can install this component.

See the full set of installation options {here}(https://github.com/alexed1/LightningFlowComponents/blob/master/install.md).

## How It Works ##

This component exposes a single attribute called "selectedTime". It can be used both as an input parameter to set the starting values and as an output parameter to pass out the selected time. 

## Roadmap ##

Most of the functionality of the underlying base component has not yet been exposed to Flow. We welcome assistance expanding the range of utility of Flow Components.

Know a little javascript and want to add some improvements? {Pull requests are welcome}(/pulls) If you're thinking of adding much complexity to the user interface, though, you probably should fork the repo, because we want to keep this baseline version easy-to-use.
