## How It Works ##

This component will appear in the APEX section of the Cloud Flow Designer palette. Drag the component onto the canvas and connect it to your Flow. The required fields are self-explanatory. You can add plaintext and/or html body fields.

This action currently requires the username and password of a SendGrid account. Future plans include support for application tokens and Named Credentials.
