# Show Toast #

### A Flow Component solution  ###

This Local Action causes a toast message to pop up.

It has two attributes. Message is the text that will be shown. The field  type can be error, warning, success, or info. The default is other, which is styled like an info toast and doesnâ€™t display an icon


## Install this Component Into Your Org ##
To use this, you must be a participant in the local Flow Actions pilot, aka the "Local Actions" pilot. Request access from customer support. 

See the full set of installation options [here](/install.md).

## How It Works ##

This component exposes a single attribute called "value". It can be used both as an input parameter to set the starting values and as an output parameter to pass out the selected time.

Know a little javascript and want to add some improvements? {Pull requests are welcome}(/pulls) If you're thinking of adding much complexity to the user interface, though, you probably should fork the repo, because we want to keep this baseline version easy-to-use.
