# Play Sound #

### A Flow Component solution  ###

- PlaySound can play audio both as a Screen Component and as a local Flow Action
- If you pass a url to source, you need to add a CSP Trusted Site entry to your Salesforce org. See Setup > CSP Trusted Sites
- You can also upload audio sources as a static resource


## Install this Component Into Your Org ##

To use this, you must be a participant in the local Flow Actions pilot, aka the "Local Actions" pilot. [Learn more](https://sites.google.com/view/flowunofficial/pilot-flow-action-components)

Know a little javascript and want to add some improvements? {Pull requests are welcome}(/pulls) If you're thinking of adding much complexity to the user interface, though, you probably should fork the repo, because we want to keep this baseline version easy-to-use.
